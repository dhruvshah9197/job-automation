## NEXT STEP: Deploy on Render

Once all files are on GitHub, follow: **CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md**

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find the Add file button"
- Make sure you're on your repository page
- Look in the top right area
- It should be near the green "Code" button

### "The files didn't upload"
- Try uploading them one by one
- Or try a different browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

### "I see an error"
- Refresh the page
- Try again

## You're Almost There! 🎉

Once files are on GitHub, Render will automatically deploy them!
